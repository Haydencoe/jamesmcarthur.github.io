<p>Finally, it was time to head into the hills. We woke bright and early, squished into our Jucy rental cars and left the hustle and bustle of Queenstown behind us. As we neared Glenorchy, we were able to catch glimpses of Mt. Earnslaw, our destination, through occasional gaps in the clouds.</p>

<p>After subjecting our ill-suited cars to miles of jarring gravel road, we arrived at the start of the track.</p>

<p>Leaving the cars in the long grass on the side of the road, we plunged into the cool beech forest. Moving from marker to marker, we followed the track as it wound gently up the valley on the true left of the Earnslaw Burn.</p>

<p>Unusually heavy snowfall in October had resulted in treefall along much of the track. Progress was slow as we squeezed between fallen tree trunks and skirted muddy bogs.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the forest ended and revealed the Earnslaw Glacier in the distance. Having been enclosed by the forest all morning, we could finally see see our surroundings—the waterfalls tumbling down on both sides of the valley as well as the glacier ahead. Above the forest, the valley flattened out. Despite leaving the official DoC track behind, travel was easy over the grassy flats.</p>

<p>As we made our way up the valley, the enormous cliff at the head of the valley came into view. It was hard to grasp the scale of the scenery. From the topo map, we worked out that the peak of Mt. Earnslaw was almost two kilometers above our position on the valley floor.</p>

<p>We arrived at a flat spot near the stream and got to work pitching the tents and making dinner. Our simple chicken pasta had been well earned!</p>

<p>With the sun setting at 10 PM, there was plenty of time to explore the valley after dinner. Wandering slowly towards the glacier, we were in awe of where we found ourselves. We were incredibly lucky with the weather—it was a perfectly still evening, the only sound the quiet roar of the waterfalls cascading down the cliff in the distance. A circus of kea flew overhead and a solitary chamois bounded through the tussock.</p>

<p>After playing cards inside one of the tents, we emerged to find the stars out in full force. Miles away from civilisation and with not a single cloud to be seen, the night sky was incredible.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of the clear night was that the temperature quickly dropped below freezing. We slowly defrosted when the sun finally peeked over the side of the valley the next morning.</p>

<p>With that, we packed up, turned around and headed back down the valley towards civilisation.</p>
