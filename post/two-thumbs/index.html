<p>We were going ski touring! This trip had been hotly anticipated by the McArthur family. Soon we would be effortlessly gliding through the Two Thumb range&rsquo;s pristine powder snow. Or so we thought—the next couple of days would teach us that ski touring is about much more than just the ride down.</p>

<p>After meeting our guides and getting kitted out with gear, we drove to our starting point at the northern end of Lake Tekapo. Unfortunately the snowline was at the hut, some 500m above us, so we had to make the climb with skis and boots on our packs.</p>

<p>We were hard to miss tramping up the side of the valley—skis and poles everywhere and Dave with his drone precariously wedged above his pack.</p>

<p>Eventually we came to a small plateau and spotted the Rex Simpson Hut in the distance. This cosy shelter would be our home for the next two nights.</p>

<p>From the hut we could look out over Lake Tekapo, with the jagged ridges of the Main Divide dominating the skyline.</p>

<p>Having made it to the hut, we were eager to get onto the snow—but before we could even put on our boots, there was a lot we had to learn. Elke, our guide, patiently explained how to operate the special ski touring bindings, how to take skins on and off our skis and the best technique for skinning uphill.</p>

<p>Clumsily, we put on our skins and followed Elke up the ridge behind the hut. Going uphill in skis was strange at first, but we soon got into a rhythm—step and glide, step and glide.</p>

<p>As the sun set, we came to a flat spot on the ride where we took off our skins and got ready to ski back down. In unfamiliar skis and in very crusty snow which was tricky to turn on, the descent was a little humbling for those in the family who fancied themselves expert skiers! Nonetheless, we all made it back to the hut, excited for our full day expedition tomorrow.</p>

<p>After a beautiful sunset and subsequent star gazing, we headed to bed early, knowing tomorrow would be a long day.</p>

<p>In the morning, we peered outside to find another beautifully clear and still day. After demolishing some porridge, we were quickly on our skis and cruising up the ridge—slightly less clumsily than yesterday.</p>

<img src="/images/two-thumbs-9-1920.jpg" />

<p>The plan for the day was to climb from the hut at 1300m to Beuzenberg Peak at 2000m, along the aptly named Snake Ridge.</p>

<p>After three hours slog uphill, we stopped for lunch halfway along the ridge, gazing out over the Alps. Our main guide—Elke—proudly pointed out Mt. Cook on the skyline and told us that she had climbed it three times, as well as pioneering a new route to the summit.</p>

<p>It was fascinating getting to know Elke and Marc, our guides. To say that they enjoyed the outdoors would be a slight understatement! Elke works as a guide full time and Marc is the head of ski patrol at Roundhill, a nearby ski field. They liked to tell us all about their exploits—daring rescues, close calls with avalanches and heroic ski tours across the Alps.</p>

<p>Two more hours toil up the ridge brought us to the spot where we would drop in and ski down the valley. We&rsquo;d learned a few things over the past five hours: what the beginning of snow blindness feels like (turns out Ray-Bans aren&rsquo;t the best ski touring eyewear), how painful touring with blisters can be and how quickly you get sunburned at elevation.</p>

<p>Still, it was worth it though as we took off our skins and followed Elke down the valley, carving our tracks into the untouched snow.</p>

<img src="/images/two-thumbs-14-1920.jpg" />

<p>We cruised slowly down the valley, savouring every hard-earned meter of elevation.</p>

<img src="/images/two-thumbs-12-1920.jpg" />

<p>Eventually the snow thinned out, so we skinned back onto the ridge and followed it downhill. We stumbled into the hut, absolutely exhausted but buzzing from our adventure.</p>

<p>The next day we only had time for a quick tour before we had to load up our backpacks and walk to the carpark.</p>

<img src="/images/two-thumbs-13-1920.jpg" />

<p>There was a contented silence in the van as we drove back to Tekapo. Ski touring had been much tougher than we expected, but earning our turns, being completely self-sufficient and having an entire mountain to ourselves—that was something quite special.</p>
