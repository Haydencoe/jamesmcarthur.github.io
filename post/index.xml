      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was time to head into the hills. We woke bright and early, squished into our Jucy rental cars and left the hustle and bustle of Queenstown behind us. As we neared Glenorchy, we were able to catch glimpses of Mt. Earnslaw, our destination, through occasional gaps in the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After subjecting our ill-suited cars to many kilometers of bone-jarring gravel road, we arrived at the start of the track.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-3.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Leaving the cars in the long grass on the side of the road, we plunged into the cool beech forest. Moving from marker to marker, we followed the track as it wound gently up the valley on the true left of the Earnslaw Burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unusually heavy snowfall in October had resulted in treefall along much of the track. Progress was slow as we squeezed between fallen tree trunks and skirted muddy bogs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-4.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the forest ended and revealed the Earnslaw Glacier in the distance. After being enclosed by the forest all morning, we were thrilled to be able to see our surroundings - the waterfalls tumbling down on both sides of the valley as well as the glacier ahead. Above the forest, the valley flattened out. Despite leaving the official DoC track behind, travel was easy over the grassy flats.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-5.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-6.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As we made our way up the valley, the enormous cliff at the head of the valley came into view. It was hard to grasp the scale of the scenery. From looking at the topo map, we worked out that the peak of Mt. Earnslaw was almost two kilometers above our position on the valley floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-7.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-8.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-9.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-10.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;https://jamesmcarthur.github.io/images/earnslaw-burn-11.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
